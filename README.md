# Dissertation Project - RULSTM Architecture

This project is designed around the improvement and developmenet of the RULSTM architecture. I have tweaked the original architecture to increase efficiency and also introduce newer architectural technologies from the field (AVT). In addition, I carried out a number of experiments to foresee potential future research within the field of computer vision.


## Features

- Tweaking sequence completion pretraining to improve performance on lower end machines.
- Longer time scale anticipation time experiments.
- Loss function experiments (MSE, Hinge, Kullback-Liebler and AVT) to increase efficiency.
- Optimiser function experiments.
- Observation Time optimisations from original architecture.
- Integrating backbone from AVT architecture.
